# Money Challenge

Props to my coworker, Orlando

New Year's Resolution!! What could we do differently this year from last year?

Hmm, we could save money! Let's save x dollars every week where x is the week number.<br />
Sounds simple enough, adding 1 to 52 to save $1,378.

What about saving x dollars multiplied by the month the week, x, falls in. So, in<br />
Week 1, you save 1 * 1<br />
Week 2, you save 2 * 1<br />
Week 3, you save 3 * 1<br />
...<br />
Week 52, you save 52 * 12

Now, here's a challenge. Write a Java program to show the total amount that will be saved in 2016<br/>
hint: use the Calendar API
